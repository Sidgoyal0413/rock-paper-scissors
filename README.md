🪨 Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple Python-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game that lets you play against the computer in the terminal.

🎮 How to Play

Run the Python script.

Enter your choice — rock, paper, or scissors.

The computer will randomly choose one as well.

The winner is decided based on the classic rules:

Rock beats Scissors

Paper beats Rock

Scissors beats Paper

Type quit anytime to stop playing.

At the end, your total score, computer’s score, and the number of ties will be displayed.

🧠 Game Logic

The program uses the random module to make the computer’s choice unpredictable.

Scores are tracked for the user, computer, and ties throughout the session.

Input is case-insensitive, so you can type in any format (e.g., "Rock" or "rock").
